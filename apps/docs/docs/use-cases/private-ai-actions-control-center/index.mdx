# Private AI-actions control center

AI applications are incredibly useful and efficient, but their power demands cautious handling.
We need to be able to control them and make sure they don't do anything we don't want them to do,
especially when they can do actions on our behalf, like sending emails, posting on social media, or even buying things online.

Connery Runner is a personal, isolated, and secure place that helps you control what every one of your AI tools can do on your behalf.

It allows you to install plugins for desired actions, set up connections to third-party services,
and precisely control which actions each AI tool can perform. You can even set certain actions to require your prior approval.
The Connery Runner will then take care of executing the actions on your behalf and will ask for your approval when needed.
Additionally, it maintains a history of all actions carried out by your AI tools, allowing you to verify that everything is in order.
