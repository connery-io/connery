# Actions in GPTs

Connect GPTs to the real world with Connery actions.

## What are GPTs?

**OpenAI** rolled out custom versions of ChatGPT that you can create for a specific purpose - called [GPTs](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts).
GPTs are a new way for anyone to create a tailored version of ChatGPT to be more helpful in their daily life, at specific tasks, at work, or at home—and then share that creation with others.
In addition to using our built-in capabilities, you can also define custom actions.
Actions allow GPTs to integrate external data or interact with the real world.
Connect GPTs to databases, plug them into emails, or make them your shopping assistant.
For example, you could integrate a travel listings database, connect a user’s email inbox, or facilitate e-commerce orders.

At the same time, **LangChain** is working on an open-source version of GPTs called [OpenGPTs](https://github.com/langchain-ai/opengpts).
OpenGPTs provides similar experiences to OpenAI GPTs and builds upon other LangChain products.
