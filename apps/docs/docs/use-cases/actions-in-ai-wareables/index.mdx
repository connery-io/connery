# Actions in AI wareables

The AI wearable market is growing fast, with new products like the
[Rewind Pendant](https://www.rewind.ai/pendant),
[Meta smart glasses](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/09/new-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses/),
[Tab](https://mytab.ai),
[Rabbit R1](https://www.rabbit.tech),
and [Humane AI Pin](https://hu.ma.ne/aipin) coming out.

Many of these devices aim to connect users to the real world and assist with daily tasks.
For instance, the [Rabbit R1 will let you run actions](https://www.rabbit.tech/keynote) from third-party services like Spotify and Uber just talking to the device.

We can expect more of these devices to emerge, allowing us to interact with various third-party services and run actions.

Imagine you want your device to do something custom or unsupported, like "turn on the light in the room."
With Connery, you can create a plugin with this action or find an open-source one already made by the community.
Then, you add this plugin to the Connery Runner and use it from your device, ensuring security and complete control over what the AI device can do.
