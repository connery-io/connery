# Use cases

Connecting AI, workflow automation, and real-world applications can serve many different use cases.
Here is how we structure it.

:::info Standard approach

Remember, the Connery approach is always the same:

1. **Get your plugin**
   1. EITHER find a pre-built plugin matching your task provided by the community
   2. OR build your own plugin for your specific needs.
2. Keep all your plugin configurations in one place (on the runner) and **execute from any client**.
   1. EITHER find a pre-built client matching your tooling provided by the community
   2. OR build your own client.

:::

## Run actions from multiple platforms

Connery is all about running actions.
Once a plugin and its actions become available in Connery, they are exposed to several platforms.
Our current strategy includes AI Agent and Chatbot platforms, Collaboration tools, and No-code automation platforms.

### AI Agents and Chatbots

Run your actions from any AI Agent or Chatbot platform.
Connery currently provides a native client for LangChain and the API.
We plan to add more clients for other AI Agent and Chatbot platforms.

### Collaboration tools

Enable your team to run actions directly using natural language. Connery provides clients for collaboration tools.
Currently available is our Slack App. Microsoft Teams, Notion, Discord, and others are likely to follow.
You can always build your own client.

Automate frequent tasks and make multiple services accessible via direct communication.

- **Skill-enhancement**: Equip a less-skilled workforce to execute complex tasks without hand-over a specialized workforce, e.g., developers.
- **Scope broadening**: Enable the workforce to perform more tasks across more tooling without learning new processes and tools.
- **Efficiency improvement**: Increase throughput by automating repetitive tasks.

### No-code automation

Automate more tasks by exposing actions to No-code platforms.
Currently available in our Make (former Integromat) client.
Zapier and other platforms are likely to follow.
You can always build your own client.

## Use case examples

End-users can effortlessly interact with and combine multiple tools without understanding their underlying mechanics or switching platforms.
While there are many possibilities, we've curated a selection of use cases that have inspired the development of Connery.

:::info Mind the "Client Type"

Many use cases apply to AI Agents and Chatbots.
Thus, the according client type is chat-based, e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, or even Notion.
Connery also supports No-code client-types, e.g., Make or Zapier.
