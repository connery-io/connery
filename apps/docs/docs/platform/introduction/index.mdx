### Core features

- **Standardized framework** for developing plugins that facilitate interactions between APIs and AI Agents.
- **SDK** to accelerate the development process.
- **Security measures** to mitigate risks associated with AI-driven actions.
- **Community-driven ecosystem** for sharing and adapting plugins across various AI platforms.

### Project goals

We aim to streamline the development of AI Agents by offering:

1. A **common standard** for building and automating third-party plugins and actions for AI Agents.
2. **Cross-platform compatibility** to ensure seamless integration with various development and automation platforms.
3. **Testing utilities** to validate and control plugin and agent behavior.

### Open-source

We're committed to open-source principles, believing that collective development accelerates innovation.
Connery is open-source, and we encourage contributions to help us achieve our goals.
