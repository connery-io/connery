# Core concepts

Here, you can find the core concepts of the Connery platform and their definitions.
We highly recommend you read this section before diving into the documentation.

## Plugin

A plugin is a collection of actions closely related by meaning and function.
Before a plugin can be used, it must be installed on a runner.
Once installed, its actions are accessible and can be run from any client.

Each plugin is represented by a GitHub repository with a specific structure.
GitHub is an excellent infrastructure for plugins that provides all the necessary tools
for development and maintenance: version control, collaboration, automation, and more.

:::info Example
A [connery-io/gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) plugin has a set of actions related to Gmail.
The plugin requires GmailEmailAddress and GmailAppPassword configuration parameters
during the installation on the runner so the actions have access to the Gmail account.
:::

You might already be familiar with the concept of a plugin.
This idea has different names across various platforms:

- **Plugin** in ChatGPT;
- **Tool** in LangChain;
- **App** in Make, Zapier, and Slack.

## Action

An action is an atomic operation designed to perform a specific task.
You can think of an action as a function with input and output parameters that can be called from many places (clients).

:::info Example
[SendEmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail/blob/main/actions/SendEmail.js) is an action in
the [connery-io/gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) plugin. It has Recipient, Subject, and Body input parameters.
Once the action is run by the client, it sends an email based on the provided input parameters
and returns a MessageId to the client as a result.
:::

## Runner

A runner is an open-source application that hosts and runs actions.
Every company or individual configures their own isolated runner with a unique plugin set and configuration.
Runner provides a security layer and access control for actions and their execution.

## Client

A client is an application that allows end users to run actions from the runner.

:::info Example
[Connery Slack App](/docs/native-clients/slack) is a client that allows users to run actions from the runner right
from the Slack workspace using natural language.
