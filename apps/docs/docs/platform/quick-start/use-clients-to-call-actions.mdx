## General authorization approach

Runner uses API Key authorization approach.
It means that every client needs to provide an API Key to the runner to call actions.

Every client has their process of configuring the connection to the runner.
It depends on the client's specifics, its user interface, and how it is used.
But the general idea is the same for all clients:
You always have to provide the **Runner URL** and **API Key** to the client to let it establish a connection with the runner.

## Configure your first client

You can choose any client you like from the growing lists of [native clients](/docs/native-clients) or [community clients](/docs/community-clients).
All the specifics of a client, its setup process, and usage are described on the client documentation page.

We recommend starting with the **Slack App** client in this tutorial.
Slack is quite popular and easy to use.

To continue the tutorial, please refer to the [Slack App](/docs/native-clients/slack) client documentation page.
