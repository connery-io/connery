# Slack App

Use natural language to run actions right in your [Slack](https://slack.com/) workspace collaborating with your team.

## Information

You can use the app by sending it direct messages or in any channel where the app is invited.
In the channels, the app can see and respond only to the messages where the app is mentioned.

For every message to the app, it calls Connery API, which
utilizes [OpenAI function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling)
to classify the user intent and identify input parameters from the message.
After classifying the intent, the app sends a request to the Connery API to run the specific action with the identified parameters and respond to the user with the result.

To use the app, you have to configure `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the [runner configuration](http://localhost:4202/docs/getting-started/set-up-runner#3-configure-env-variables) so the Runner can use OpenAI API to classify the user intent and identify input parameters from messages.

To use the app, you need to install it in your Slack workspace and configure it to connect to your Runner.
