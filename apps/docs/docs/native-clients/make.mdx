# Make App

Run actions from the no-code platform [Make](https://www.make.com/) using them in your workflows and combining them with the other apps and capabilities of Make.

## Information

The advantage of using the Make app is that you can use actions from your runner as a part of no-code workflows and combining with the other apps and capabilities of Make.

The Make App has the followign actions:

| Make action (module)              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Run action                        | This Make action lets you select an action from the runner, specify input parameters, and run it.<br/><br/>This action does not use OpenAI API and runs actions directly from the runner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Run action using natural language | This Make action lets you run action from the runner using natural language, similar to how the [Connery app in Slack](/docs/native-clients/slack#information) works using OpenAI API for classification.<br/><br/>To use the app, you have to configure `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the [runner configuration](http://localhost:4202/docs/quick-start/set-up-runner#3-configure-env-variables) so the Runner can use OpenAI API to classify the user intent and identify input parameters from messages. |

:::info Tricky terminology

Please note that Make also uses the term "action" to describe a simple operation. Sometimes they also call it a "module", though.

The Make actions listed in the table above are proxies that allow you to call actions from your Connery runner.
That's why the app has an action called "Run action" ðŸ¤­
