## Information

The advantage of using the Make app is that you can use actions from your runner as a part of no-code workflows and combining with the other apps and capabilities of Make.

The Make App has the followign actions:

| Action                            | Description                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Run action                        | Let you select action from the runner, specify input parameters and run it.                                             |
| Run action using natural language | Let you run action using natural language, similar to how the [Connery app in Slack](/docs/native-clients/slack) works. |

:::info Tricky terminology

Please note that Make also uses the term "action" to describe a simple operation.
The Make actions listed in the table above are proxies that allow you to call actions from your Connery runner.
That's why the Make App has an action called "Run action" ðŸ¤­
