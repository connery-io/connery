# Configuration

Here, you can find how to configure the plugin server.

All configuration is done through environment variables.
During the development, you can set them in the `.env` file at the root of the project.
By default, the `.env` file is added to the `.gitignore` file of the plugin repository, so it won't be committed to the repository.

## Environment variables

### `PLUGIN_SERVER_URL`

Required: Yes.

The URL of the plugin server.
This is a public URL where the plugin server is available.
It is required by the OpenAPI spec to work properly.

### `API_KEY`

Required: Yes.

The API key that the plugin server will use to validate incoming requests.

### `HOSTING_MODE`

Required: No.

Default: `STANDARD`.

The hosting mode adjusts the behavior of the plugin server to the specific environment where it is running.

Available values:

- `STANDARD` - Use this mode to run the plugin server as a standalone application or in a container.
- `AWS_LAMBDA` - Use this mode to run the plugin server in AWS Lambda.

### `CONFIG_<configurationParameterKey>`

Required: Depends on the configuration parameter validation rules in the plugin definition.

Use this environment variable to set the value of a configuration parameter of the plugin.

Replace the `<configurationParameterKey>` with the key of the configuration parameter from the plugin definition.
For example, if the plugin definition has a configuration parameter with the key `emailAdress`, you would set the environment variable `CONFIG_emailAdress` to the value you want to use.
Then, the plugin server passes this value to the plugin and its actions.
So you can access it in the action handler from the [action context object](/docs/sdk/api-reference#action-context-types):

```typescript
async function actionHandler(context: ActionContext): Promise<OutputObject> {
  // This will print the value of the CONFIG_emailAdress environment variable
  console.log(context.configuration.emailAdress);

  return {};
}
```
