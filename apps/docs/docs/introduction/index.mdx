# 🤙🏼👁️ Introduction

Connery is an **open source connector platform and ecosystem** for developers. Its main purpose is to provide infrastructure and pre-built components to enable AI agents and no-code automations to access real-world applications.

### 📦 Value proposition

- **Standard framework** to create and control connectors and actions between third party applications and AI models
- **Open source infrastructure and pre-built components** to speed-up development
- **Security and protection processes** to reduce unwanted outcomes when using AI
- **Free ecosystem for sharing and reusing** connectors with a broader audience across different AI models and platforms

### 🎯 Our mission: creating a fully automated world run by humans

We believe that there will be a myriad of autonomous AI agents for tens of thousands of specific purposes. Building performant agents requires:

1. A **standard** for AI agent development and automation
2. **Interoperability** with agent development and automation platforms
3. **Testing** and controlling capabilities

### 🌍 Open source

We believe the only way to achieve our mission is to share and reuse development as much as possible. Therefore, we built Connery as an open source platform.

### 🛠️ Platform components

**Details**

1. Open-source **Connectors** built by the community for many different purposes. Every connector is a separate open-source GitHub repository maintained by the community.
2. Companies or individuals configure their own isolated **Runner** with a unique connector set and configuration. You may also start with pre-built runners.
3. The **Runner pulls connectors** from GitHub based on the runner configuration.
4. The **Runner exposes actions** to clients and end users based on access configurations.
5. End users use **clients** to automate their work in different ways from different places. Additionally, anyone can build their own clients based on the runner API.
6. The Runner establishes secure and persistent connections to **third-party services** for every installed connector.
7. (optional) The Runner uses Large Language Models (LLM) to **support Natural Language Actions**. LLM can enable the Runner to classify user intent, identify input parameters and run actions based on user prompt. This is optional. Any Runner can also be used without LLM.
