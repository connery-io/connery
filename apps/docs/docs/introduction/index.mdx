# Introduction

Connery is an open-source platform designed to simplify the integration between AI agents,
no-code automations, and real-world applications.
It serves as a foundational layer for building and managing connectors.

### Core Features

- **Standardized framework** for developing connectors that facilitate interactions between third-party apps and AI agents.
- **Open-source modules and components** to accelerate the development process.
- **Security measures** to mitigate risks associated with AI-driven actions.
- **Community-driven ecosystem** for sharing and adapting connectors across various AI platforms.

### Project Goals

Our aim is to streamline the development of AI agents by offering:

1. A **common standard** for building and automating third-party connectors and actions for AI agents.
2. **Cross-platform compatibility** to ensure seamless integration with various development and automation platforms.
3. **Testing utilities** to validate and control connector and agent behavior.

### Open source

We're committed to open-source principles, as we believe that collective development accelerates innovation.
Connery is open-source, and we encourage contributions to help us achieve our goals.
