- [x] Action output parameters and validation
- [x] Testing framework
- [x] Dependencies management
- [ ] "Trigger" action type

### CLI

We built a CLI to simplify the development process.
It provides the following features.

| Status | Feature                                | Description                                                                                        |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅     | Initialize connector repository        | Scafold the repository structure and files based on the predefined template.                       |
| ✅     | Create a new action                    | Scafold a new action based on the predefined template.                                             |
| ✅     | Run an action                          | Very useful for testing and debugging during development.                                          |
| ✅     | Validate connector definition          | Validate if connector and actions are defined correctly and follow the required structure.         |
| ✅     | Build a connector and its dependencies | Build a connector and its dependencies into a single file, which can be used to run the connector. |

### Essential tooling for SDLC

As every connector is a separate GitHub repository,
it enables treating connector as a separate project with all the benefits
of GitHub infrastructure for development and support.
