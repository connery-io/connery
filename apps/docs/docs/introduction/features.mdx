# Features and roadmap

Connery is in early beta, so only the essential features are currently implemented.
However, we list all the features here to give you an overview of what is coming next and show you the big picture.

The features are not listed in any particular order.

### Security

| Status | Feature                 | Description                                                                                                                          |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 游릭     | Isolated environment    | The runner is designed as a dedicated instance for the company's or individual use.                                                  |

| 游댮     | Actions manual approval | To let the human make the final decision on the action execution. It is especially helpful if AI Agents or Chatbots run the actions. |

### Access management

**User access management**

This is about user access to the runner, its connectors, and actions.

| Status | Feature        | Description                                                   |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 游댮     | Authentication |                                                               |
| 游댮     | Access control | To control which user can access which connector and actions. |

**Client access management**

This is about client access to the runner, its connectors, and actions.

| Status | Feature        | Description                                                     |
| ------ | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 游릭     | Authentication | Using API keys.                                                 |
| 游댮     | Access control | To control which client can access which connector and actions. |

**API connection management**

This is about connector access to the third-party APIs and connection management.
For example, to access your Gmail account, the connector has to be connected to your Gmail account using Oauth2,
and then the Runner has to store the connection securely, control access to it, and use it when needed.

| Status | Feature  | Description                                                        |
| ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 游릭     | API keys | Possibility to authorize with the third-party APIs using API keys. |
| 游댮     | Oauth2   |                                                                    |

### Natural Language Actions (NLA)

Runner uses LLMs to understand natural language requests from users, classify the intent, and then
identify the action and its input parameters.

Currently, Connery provides native clients for [Slack](/docs/native-clients/slack)
and [Make](/docs/native-clients/slack) that utilize this feature and allow users
to run actions using natural language.

| Status | Feature                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                               |

| 游릭     | NLA based on OpenAI GPT-3 API                             | The runner uses [OpenAI function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling) to identify action and input parameters based on the user prompt. |
| 游댮     | NLA based on custom LLM                                   |                                                                                                                                                                           |

### Essential tooling for SDLC

As every connector is a separate GitHub repository, it enables treating the connector
as an independent project with all the benefits of GitHub infrastructure for development and support.
