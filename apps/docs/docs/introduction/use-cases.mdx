# Use cases

Connecting AI, workflow automation and real-world applications can serve many different use cases.
Here is how we structure it.

:::info Standard approach

Remember, the Connery approach is always the same:

1. **Get your connector**
   1. EITHER find a pre-built connector matching your task provided by the community
   2. OR build an own connector for your specific needs
2. Keep all your connector configuration in one place (on the runner) and **execute from any client**
   1. EITHER find a pre-built client matching your tooling provided by the community
   2. OR build your own client

:::

## Run actions from multiple platforms

Connery is all about running actions.
Once a connector and its actions become available in Connery they are exposed to several platforms.
Our current strategy includes AI agent & chatbot platforms, Communication tooling and No-code automation platforms.

### AI agents and chatbots

Run your actions from any AI agent or chatbot platform.
Connery currently provides a native client for LangChain and is accessible through the API.
We plan to add more clients for other AI agent platforms.

### Communication tooling

Enable your team to run actions directly using natural language. Connery provides clients for communication tools.
Currently available is our Slack Client. Microsoft Teams, Notion, Discord and others are likely to follow.
You can always build your own client.

Automate frequent tasks and/or make multiple Apps accessible via direct communication.

- **Skill-enhancement**: Equip a less-skilled workforce to execute complex tasks without hand-over to specialized workforce, e.g. developers.
- **Scope broadening**: Enable workforce to perform more tasks across more tooling without learning new processes and tools.
- **Efficiency improvement**: Increase throughput by automating repetitive tasks.

### No-code automation

Automate more tasks by exposing customized actions to No-code platforms.
Actions can be customized and simplified for optimal access from no-code users.
Currently available is our Make (former Integromat) client.
Zapier and other platforms are likely to follow.
You can always build your own client.

## Use case examples

End-users can effortlessly interact with and combine multiple tools, without needing to understand their underlying mechanics or switch platforms.
While there is many possibilities, we've curated a selection of use-cases that have inspired the development of Connery.

Mind the 'Client-type': many use cases apply to AI agents and chatbots. Thus, the according client type is chat-based, e.g. Slack, MS-Teams, Discord or even Notion. Connery also supports No-code client-types, e.g. Make (former Integromat) or Zapier.
