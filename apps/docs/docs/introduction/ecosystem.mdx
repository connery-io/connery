# Ecosystem

![Connery ecosystem](/img/connery-ecosystem.png)

1. Community builds open-source connectors for many different purposes.
   Every connector is a separate open-source GitHub repository maintained by the community.
2. A company or an individual configures their own isolated runner with a unique connector set and configuration.
3. Runner pulls connectors from GitHub based on the runner configuration.
4. Runner exposes actions to clients and end users based on the access configuration.
5. End users use clients to automate their work in different ways from different places. Additionally community can build their own clients based on the runner API.
6. Runner securely keeps connections to third-party services for every installed connector.
7. (optional) Runner uses Large Language Models to support Natural Language Actions feature. Runner utilizes LLMs to classify user intent, identify input parameters and run the action based on the user prompt.
