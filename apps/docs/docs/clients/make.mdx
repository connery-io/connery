# Make

Run Connery actions from the No-Code platform [Make](https://www.make.com/) using them in your workflows and combining them with the other apps and capabilities of Make.

## Information

The advantage of using the Make app is that you can use actions from your runner as a part of No-Code workflows and combine them with the other apps and capabilities of Make.

The Make app has the following actions:

| Make action (module) | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Run an Action        | This Make action lets you select an action from the runner, specify input parameters, and run it.<br/><br/>This action does not use OpenAI API and runs actions directly from the runner. |

:::info Tricky terminology

Please note that Make also uses the term "action" to describe a simple operation. Sometimes they also call it a "module", though.

The Make actions listed in the table above are proxies that allow you to call actions from your Connery runner.
That's why the app has an action called "Run an Action" ðŸ¤­

## Installation

Connery app installation is not needed.
The app is oficially verified by Make and [added to the marketplace](https://www.make.com/en/integrations/connery),
so it is automatically available in every Make organization.
Please follow the steps below to start using the app.

## Configuration

To call actions from your runner, you need to create a new scenario in Make and
configure the connection to the runner by providing the Runner URL and the API Key.

Follow the steps below to configure the connection:

1. Press the **"+"** button to add a new application to your scenario.

</p>

2. Search for **Connery** in the search field.
3. Select the **Connery** app in the list.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/make/create-scenario2.png" alt="Make app configuration" />
</p>

4. Select **Run action** from the list of actions in the **Connery** app.

<p align="center">

</p>

5. Press the **Create a connection** button.
6. Provide the **Runner URL**.
7. Provide the **API Key**.
8. Press the **Save** button to create the connection.

</p>

Once the connection is created, you can start using actions from your runner in your workflows as described below.

## Usage

In the example below, we will use the **Send email** action from the **Gmail** plugin from the runner.

Once you create the connection, it will be automatically selected as an active connection for the action.
After you choose **Gmail** plugin and **Send email** action,
the form will reload, and you will see all the input parameters for the action.

Let's fill in the form and run the action.

1. Specify the **Email Recipient**.
2. Specify the **Email Subject**.
3. Specify the **Email Body**.
4. Press the **OK** button to save the action.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/make/create-scenario5.png" alt="Make app usage" />
</p>

5. Press the **Run once** button to run the scenario.
6. Press the bubble to see the result of the action execution.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/make/create-scenario6.png" alt="Make app usage" />
</p>

In the result execution, you will see the action's output parameter **Message ID**.
Also, you can see all the input parameters used to run the action.
You can use the output parameters of the action in the next steps of your workflow if you need to.

</p>

Also, you can use the Connery app in combination with the thousands of other apps in Make.
For example, you can read data about email recipients from Google Sheets and use it as input parameters for the **Send email** action.
So when you run the scenario, the action will send emails to all the recipients from the Google Sheets.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/make/create-scenario8.png" alt="Make app usage" />
</p>

Below, you can see how the **Send email** action uses the input parameters from the Google Sheets.
