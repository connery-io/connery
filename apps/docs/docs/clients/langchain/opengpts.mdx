# OpenGPTs

[OpenGPTs](https://github.com/langchain-ai/opengpts) is an open-source effort from LangChain to create a similar experience to OpenAI's GPTs and Assistants API.

Connery is integrated with OpenGPTs so you can run Connery actions from OpenGPTs without any additional setup.

# Demo

[Here](https://opengpts-example-vz4y4ooboq-uc.a.run.app/), you'll find a demo version of OpenGPTs hosted by LangChain.
It comes with a preconfigured Connery Runner and all the necessary actions for the demo below.

# How to set up OpenGPTs with Connery

To configure your own OpenGPT and actions, perform the following steps:

1. Set up the Connery Runner using the [Quickstart](/docs/runner/quick-start/) guide.
2. Install plugins with the actions you want to use in your agent.
3. Fork the [OpenGPTs repo](https://github.com/langchain-ai/opengpts) and configure it as specified in the README.
4. Specify the `CONNERY_RUNNER_URL` and `CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY` environment variables in the `.env` file of the OpenGPTs to connect it to your Connery Runner.
