# Slack App

Use natural language to run actions in your [Slack](https://slack.com/) workspace, collaborating with your team.

## Information

You can use the app by sending it direct messages or in any channel where the app is invited.
In the channels, the app can see and respond only to the messages where the app is mentioned.

For every message to the app, it calls Connery API, which
utilizes [OpenAI function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling)
to identify the action and prefill input parameters based on the user's natural language request.
After that, the app shows the action form to the user with prefilled input parameters. So the user can review and change the input parameters, if required, and run the action.
In the end, the app shows the result of the action to the user or an error message if the action failed.
See the demo below in the Usage section.

To use the app, you must configure `OPENAI_API_KEY`
in the [runner configuration](http://localhost:4202/docs/quick-start/set-up-runner#3-configure-env-variables)
so the runner can use OpenAI API to classify the user intent to identify the action and prefill input parameters based on the user's natural language request.

Let's install the app in your Slack workspace and configure it to connect to your runner.
