# LangChain OpenGPTs

OpenGPTs is an open-source effort to create a similar experience to OpenAI's GPTs and Assistants API.

OpenGPTs is built upon other LangChain products, so you can use the [Connery Action Tool and Connery Toolkit](/docs/clients/native/langchain/tools) to integrate Connery actions into your OpenGPTs application.

Check out the [OpenGPTs repository](https://github.com/langchain-ai/opengpts) for more information and examples.
