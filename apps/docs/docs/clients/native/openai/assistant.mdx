# Assistants API

Use Connery actions in Function Calling tool of OpenAI Assistants API.

## Information

The Assistants API allows you to build AI assistants within your own applications.
An Assistant has instructions and can leverage models, tools, and knowledge to respond to user queries.
The Assistants API currently supports three types of tools: Code Interpreter, Retrieval, and _Function Calling_.

Function calling allows you to describe functions to the Assistants and have it intelligently return the functions that need to be called along with their arguments.
The Assistants API will pause execution during a Run when it invokes functions, and you can supply the results of the function call back to continue the Run execution.

Connery actions can easily be used in the Function Calling tool of OpenAI Assistants API.
See below for instructions on configuring and using Connery actions in the Assistant.

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

If you are new to Connery, we recommend you start with the [Quickstart](/docs/platform/quick-start/) guide.
There, you will find all the information required to set up Connery and start using it.

### Configure functions in the Assistant

1. **Get OpenAI Functions specification for Connery actions installed on the runner.**

```
curl -L '<PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL>/v1/actions/specs/openai-functions' \
-H 'x-api-key: <CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY>'
```

The `<PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL>` and `<CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY>` you should get during the runner setup in the [Quickstart](/docs/platform/quick-start/) guide.

In response, you will get an OpenAI Function specification for every action installed on your Connery runner.

2. **Use the specification to add functions to your assistant.**

You can do it using Assistant API.
See the [Defining functions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/defining-functions) section of the Assistants AI documentation for more information.

Also, you can do it on the [Assistants](https://platform.openai.com/assistants) or [Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground) pages on the OpenAI developer platform.

:::info

The UI does not allow adding an array of functions at once. So you need to add them one by one.

:::

Once you add the functions, you can use them as any other functions in the Function Calling tool of the Assistants API.

## Usage

1. **Get functions from the model that have to be called.**

When you initiate a Run with a user Message that triggers the function, the model can provide multiple functions.
See the [Reading the functions called by the Assistant](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/reading-the-functions-called-by-the-assistant) section of the Assistants AI documentation for more information.

2. **Resolve the function name to the Connery action.**

```
curl -L '<PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL>/v1/actions/specs/resolve-action-from-specs?specActionKey=<FUNCTION_NAME>' \
-H 'x-api-key: <CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY>'
```

Replace `<FUNCTION_NAME>` with the function name you got from the model.

In the response you will get the Plugin ID and Action ID which you can then use to run the action in the runner.

:::info

Because of the limitation of the OpenAI Function specification, we can not put the Plugin ID and Action ID in the function name.
So, we use a short hashed action key in the OpenAI Function specification.
Then we resolve it to the Plugin ID and Action ID required to run the action on the runner.

This is a temporary solution which will be adjusted in the future.

:::

3. **Run the action on the runner and get the result.**

Use the following API endpoint to run the action:

```
curl -L '<PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL>/v1/plugins/<PLUGIN_ID>/actions/<ACTION_ID>/run' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'x-api-key: <CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY>' \
-d '<ARGUMENTS>'
```

Replace `<PLUGIN_ID>` and `<ACTION_ID>` with the values you got from the previous step.

Replace `<ARGUMENTS>` with the arguments you got from the model.
It should be a flat JSON object like this:

```
{
  "argument1": "value1",
  "argument2": "value2"
}
```

After the action is executed, you will get the result in the response.

4. **Send the result back to the model.**

See the [Submitting functions outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/submitting-functions-outputs) section of the Assistants AI documentation for more information.
