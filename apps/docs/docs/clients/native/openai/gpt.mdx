# GPTs

Use Connery actions in your OpenAI GPTs to make them more powerful.

## Demo

See below a demo of how we use Connery's **Send email** action in the GPT to write and send emails.

## Information

OpenAI released a custom version of ChatGPT that you can create for a specific purpose â€” called GPTs.
GPTs provide the ability to deeply customize ChatGPT with all new capabilities.
In addition to using our built-in capabilities, you can also define custom actions by making one or more APIs available to the GPT.
Actions allow GPTs to integrate external data or interact with the real world.
Connect GPTs to databases, plug them into emails, or make them your shopping assistant.

And Connery can significantly help you with that.
With Connery, you can easily create and manage your own custom actions and use them in your GPTs.
Connery will take care of the action running, authorization, and provide you the OpenAPI schema compatible with OpenAI GPTs.

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

If you are new to Connery, we recommend you start with the [Quickstart](/docs/platform/quick-start/) guide.
There, you will find all the information required to set up Connery and start using it.

:::info Runner Public URL

OpenAPI schema contains the URL of your runner to let GPTs know where to send requests.
Therefore, you need to configure the public URL of your runner in the `CONNERY_RUNNER_PUBLIC_URL` environment variable in the `.env` file.

:::

We also recommend installing the [connery-io/gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) plugin on your runner, as we use it in this demo to send emails.

In addition to that, you will need to create a GPT to use the actions from Connery.
In this demo, we use a GPT with the following configuration:

| Configuration Name    | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Description           | This GPT helps me write emails and then send them from my email address using Connery actions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

It will always request confirmation before sending an email and will ask specific questions to gather all necessary details for the email's completion. The assistant will maintain a neutral and professional demeanor throughout the interaction. When addressing the user, it will use the name Volodymyr and apply a consistent sign-off in the emails. |

### Set up actions in the GPT

Once you have a Connery runner up and running and a GPT created, you can add Connery actions to it.

1. **Get OpenAPI schema** with all the actions installed on your runner

To get the OpenAPI schema, you must send a request to your runner's `GET /v1/actions/specs/openapi` endpoint.
The endpoint is private and requires an API Key for safety reasons.

Use the following cURL to get the OpenAPI schema:

```
curl -L '<PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL>/v1/actions/specs/openapi' \
-H 'x-api-key: <CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY>'
```

The `<PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL>` and `<CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY>` you should get during the runner setup in the [Quickstart](/docs/platform/quick-start/) guide.

2. Open the **Configuration** section of your GPT.
3. Scroll down to the **Actions** section and click the **Add actions** button.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/openai/actions-configuration-in-gpt-1@2x.png"
    alt="Actions configuration in GPT"
  />
</p>

4. Paste the OpenAPI schema you got from the runner into the **Schema** field.
5. Check the list of actions detected in the schema.
6. Click the **Edit** button in the **Authentication** section to configure the authentication method for the actions.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/openai/actions-configuration-in-gpt-2@2x.png"
    alt="Actions configuration in GPT"
  />
</p>

7. Select the **API Key** authentication type.
8. Paste the API Key of your runner into the **API Key** field.
9. Select the **Custom** auth type.
10. Use the `x-api-key` as a **Custom Header Name**.
11. Click the **Save** button.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/openai/actions-configuration-in-gpt-3@2x.png"
    alt="Actions configuration in GPT"
  />
</p>

12. Press **Update** on the top right corner to update the GPT.
13. Press **Confirm** to confirm the update.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/openai/actions-configuration-in-gpt-4@2x.png"
    alt="Actions configuration in GPT"
  />
</p>

Now, you're ready to use the actions in your GPT.

:::tip One action - multiple opportunities

Once the action is configured on Connery Runner, you can use it not only in the GPT but also on many other platforms.
Check the list of [Clients](/docs/clients/native/) to see what platforms are supported.
