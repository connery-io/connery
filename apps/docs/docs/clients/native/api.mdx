# API

Use the Connery API to create your own client based on the Connery plugin infrastructure.

## Actions API

Connery Runner exposes a dynamic OpenAPI schema that describes all the actions available on your runner.

To get the OpenAPI schema, send a request to your runner's `GET /v1/actions/openapi` endpoint.
The endpoint is private and requires an API Key for safety reasons.

Use the following cURL to get the OpenAPI schema:

```
curl -L '<PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL>/v1/actions/openapi' \
-H 'x-api-key: <CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY>'
```

The `<PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL>` and `<CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY>` you should get during the runner setup in the [Quickstart](/docs/platform/quick-start/) guide.

:::info Runner Public URL

OpenAPI schema contains the URL of your runner in the `servers` section.
Therefore, you need to configure the public URL of your runner in the `CONNERY_RUNNER_PUBLIC_URL` environment variable in the `.env` file.

:::

The open API schema contains complete information about all the actions available on your runner, including their input and output parameters.
