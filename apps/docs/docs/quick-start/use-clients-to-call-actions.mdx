## General authirization approach

---

TODO:

- How to authorize any client to work with your runner?
- Describe general way of authirization across all clients
  - Authorize client to work with your runner by providing:
    - Runner URL
    - API Key
      - We recommend to use a seperate API Key for every client.
      - You can specify API key in the Runner configuration file.

## Configure client

You can choose any client you like from the list of available clinets (which is growing)

- Every client has their own process how to configure the access to the runner.
- Please refer to the client documentation for more details.

We recommend to start with the [Slack App](/docs/native-clients/slack) client.
