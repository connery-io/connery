## 1. Open and understand the configuration file

Open the runner configuration file `./apps/runner/connery-runner.config.ts` in the codespace.

Among the other configuration parameters, you can see the `InstalledConnectors` section.
`InstalledConnectors` is an array of connector configurations which already contains one connector: `connery-io/connery-runner-administration@main`.
This connector is used to manage the runner and it's preinstalled on the runner by default.

```ts
...
InstalledConnectors: [
  {
    Key: 'connery-io/connery-runner-administration@main',
    ConfigurationParameters: {
      RunenrUrl: 'http://localhost:4201',
      RunnerApiKey: process.env.CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY,
    },
  },
],
...
```

Every connector configuration has the `Key` and `ConfigurationParameters` properties.

The `Key` is a unique identifier of the connector which has the following format: `owner/repository@branch`.
As you can see it has a direct relation to the GitHub repository where the connector is stored.
For example, the `connery-io/connery-runner-administration@main` connector is stored
in the https://github.com/connery-io/connery-runner-administration GitHub repository and uses the code from the `main` branch.
The branch is used for versioning and can be replaced with a tag.

The `ConfigurationParameters` is a flat key-value object that contains the configuration parameters for the connector.
Configuration parameters are specific for each connector and you can find them in the connector definition file in the related GitHub repository.
For example the `connery-io/connery-runner-administration@main` connector has the configuration parameters
defined in the `configurationParameters` section of its definition file [index.js](https://github.com/connery-io/connery-runner-administration/blob/main/index.js) in the root of the GitHub repository.
From the definition file you can see that both `RunenrUrl` and `RunnerApiKey` configuration parameters are required, so they must be provided in the connector configuration.

The configuration parameters are used by the actions of this connector to perform their tasks.

## 2. Add connector configuration

Let's now install the [connery-io/gmail@main](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail/tree/main) connector on the runner.
It has an action that sends an email using the Gmail API.

First of all we need to check the connector definition file [index.js](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail/blob/main/index.js) and find the configuration parameters we need to provide.
Based on the definition file the configuration parameters are:

- `GmailEmailAddress` (required)
- `GmailAppPassword` (required)
- `SenderName` (optional)

So let's add the connector configuration to the end of the `InstalledConnectors` array in the runner configuration file like the following:

```ts
...
configurationParameters: [
  ...
  {
    Key: 'connery-io/gmail@main',
    ConfigurationParameters:
    {
      GmailEmailAddress: '<GMAIL_EMAIL_ADRESS>',
      GmailAppPassword: '<GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD>',
      SenderName: '<SENDER_NAME>'
    }
  }
],
...
```

Replace the `<GMAIL_EMAIL_ADRESS>`, `<GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD>` and `<SENDER_NAME>` placeholders with the actual values.<br/>
Check the [Sign in with app passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) article from Google Support to learn how to generate the app password for your Gmail account.

If the runner is still running in your codespace, the configuration will be automatically applied after sving the file.
On the next API request to the runner, it will download the connector from the GitHub repository and cache it.

:::info

If you want to install connector from the private GitHub repository, you need to configure the Personal Access Token (`GITHUB_PAT`) in the `.env` file.
So the runner can access the private repository and can download the connector.

:::

If you want to update the installed connectors with the latest changes from their repositories,
run the `ClearConnectorCache` action of the `connery-io/connery-runner-administration@main` connector as was shown [on the previous page](/docs/quick-start/set-up-runner#run-action-using-api).
This will clean the connectors cache on the runner and download the latest version of the connectors from the specified branch or tag.
You don't need to restart the runner after that.

## Next steps

Now, when you have the runner configured and the connectors installed, you can learn how to [use clients](/docs/quick-start/use-clients-to-call-actions) to call actions from the connectors.
