# Install connector on the runner

---

TODO:

Add connector Key with the version or branch to the runner configuration file.

Provide required and optional configuration parameters for the connector.
See connector definition file to see the configuration parameters for the connector.

NOTE: You don't need to deploy the connector on the runner, the runner will download it automatically from the specified GitHub repository and the specified version or branch

After you installed all the connectors you need, restart the runner so it uses the new configuration if you run it locally.
Or re-deploy the runner if you run it in a cloud.

Once the connector is installed ion the runner, you don't need to re-deploy it after each change in the connector. Just use the standard connector preinstalled on the runner to clear connector cache and download the new version of your connector from the sspecified branch or tag.

Mention default pre-installed connectors. You can see the list of connectors in the runner configuration file `./apps/runner/connery-runner.config.ts`.

- Recommendation regarding versioning (use specific version instead of main if possible)

TODO:

- when in config, mention that secrets are pulled from .env file
