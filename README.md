## ü§î What is this?

**Connery is a middleware runtime between APIs and platforms. With Connery, you can turn any API into a standardized plugin with built-in auth, security, and access management and use it across different platforms.**

Many **AI platforms** are gaining momentum on the market ‚Äî for instance, OpenAI with GPTs, LangChain, AI-powered chatbots, and agents.

Also, many **no-code platforms**, such as Zapier and Make, allow you to connect different services together and build automation workflows.

To fully leverage the capabilities of these platforms, it's essential to connect them with your APIs, like SaaS applications, databases, back-end services, and so on.

While APIs provide a fundamental bridge for connectivity, their integration often requires customization into platform-specific applications, adhering to diverse platform standards. This necessity introduces a complex array of challenges, particularly in areas of authentication, security, and access management, which are critical for seamless and secure operations.

This is where Connery comes into play.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How does it work?

Connery consists of four main components that tightly work together:

**Action** - Think of an action as a basic task, something like a function with input and output parameters designed to do one specific thing.
For example, "Send an email" is an action in the "Gmail" _plugin_.

**Plugin** - This is a collection of related actions grouped together because they serve a similar purpose.
Each plugin is represented by a GitHub repository with TypeScript code of a specific structure.
Plugin must be installed on a _runner_ before its actions can be used.

**Runner** - This is the heart of Connery, an open-source application that knows how to handle plugins and run actions.
It's equipped with key features like authentication handling, security, and access management.
Each organization or individual configures their own isolated runner with a unique plugin set and configuration.
The runner provides a standardized API for every installed action that can be consumed by _clients_.

**Client** - A client is a specific application for each platform that uses the API provided by the runner.
It's like a translator that adapts the runner's capabilities to fit the platform's needs.
For example, a Slack App client allows to run actions right from Slack.

The combination of these components allows you to run actions from any platform supported by Connery. For example, you can run the same action from Slack, OpenAI GPT or Make.
